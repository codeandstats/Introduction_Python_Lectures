# Introduction to Python Lectures

Welcome to the most important course you'll ever take: Introduction to Coding ðŸ™„


I will lean heavily on the book [Python for Data Analysis](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) (as well as the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook)).

The first few weeks will focus on the fundamentals of data types and flow structures while the ultimate goal of the course will be to introduce you to *statistical thinking, data literacy* and *modeling*.
